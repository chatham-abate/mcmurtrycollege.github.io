This is a sample post to the McMurtry website. To see the format of this file, log in, click on the file, and then click on the **PENCIL** icon to view syntax. 

#### how to write a post

The first thing you should notice is the '---' section at the very top of the page. This is necessary in each post that you make. 

* Layout: should always be set to post.
* Title: whatever the title of the post is.
* Author: your name!
* Excerpt: if the file is longer than one paragraph, then include "Excerpt: [first paragraph of post]" as in this example. Otherwise, it is not necessary.

Everything else under the second '---' is the content of the post.

#### how to add a post

1. If you're reading this, that means you're already on the Github. You should be logged in. Navigate to the _posts folder and click on NEW FILE. 
2. Filename should be in the format of '**YYYY-MM-DD-title.md**'. For example: **2016-02-15-sample.md**
3. You can follow the format of this file to write the body of the post. Click on the **PENCIL** icon to view syntax. (There are some more markdown tips further down)
4. Once done, there should be a 'Commit New File' option. The first input box is a description -- this is necessary. You can follow the format 'posted [title of post]'. Leave the radio button at 'Commit directly to master'. You should now be able to click 'Commit new file'. 
5. You're done! Yay! Celebrate!

#### markdown tips

This is how you create a bulleted list (all three are identical, so take your pick):

* Bullet Item
+ Bullet Item
- Bullet Item

To create a numbered list, just do numbers with a period after. Leave a new line before the list to ensure indenting.

1. This
2. Is
3. A
4. Numbered List

This is **bold** text. This is *italic* text. [This is a hyperlink](http://www.google.com/)
