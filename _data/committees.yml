                description: Beer Bike. Some say it's the best day of the year. Others say it's the best day of their lives (with the exception of the other Beer Bikes they were fortunate enough to attend). The Beer Bike Committee is in charge of making this monumentous day a reality for all of McMurtry to enjoy. Whether it be assisting the Biking or Chugging Teams, organizing water balloon filling, or rounding people up for an epic jack on… Duncan (of course) – there is something for everyone to do!

                description: The McMurtry Cultural Committee exists to engage students in the diversity of the Houston community. Currently, Culturals subsidizes ethnic restaurants along the METRO-rail, provides themed study breaks, and is responsible for the college Hookah, amongst other fascinating cultural things. The committee also facilitates opportunities for free events and shows in Houston through a liason with RPC. Here mostly to provide McMurtry with free food and concerts, the Cultural Committee ensures McMurtry is never short of fun things to do both within and beyond the hedges.

                description: External Socials are simply put, very very social. We plan events that feature Murts interacting with other colleges, including McMurtry's public party and Pub night. Our goal is to create activities that every Murt would love to participate in and to find ways to make sure every member of our college feels connected to the community by simply doing FUN STUFF. We are always ready to hear any input that anyone might have, and we cannot wait to make this an amazing year!
