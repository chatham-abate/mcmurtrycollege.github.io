	<h2> Welcome </h2>
	<div class='section-text'>
		<p> On behalf of the entire crew, we would like to welcome you aboard the Starship McMurtry! We are Kelsi, Matt, and Rachel, your 2016 McMurtry O-Week Coordinators, and we could not be more excited for you to embark on this journey with us as we introduce you to your new universe that we like to call Rice Universe(ity).  </p>
		<p> So, we don’t actually have a real-life spaceship yet (we’re eagerly awaiting a call from NASA), but we assure you that what we lack in hardware we more than make up for in the excitement for your impending arrival. We know that the college application process was rigorous and and time-consuming, but we want you to know that it was all worth it, and we congratulate you on not only being accepted to Rice, but also making the wise decision to join us here. And, in the spirit of being official, we’d like to officially, for the first time (from us, at least), congratulate each and every one of y’all on being an integral part of the Matriculating Class of 2016! We hope that throughout your time here, you take advantage of the many opportunities that Rice provides and truly make this experience your own. </p>
		<p> One of the most wonderful and unique aspects of Rice is the residential college system. You have the great honor of being the eighth matriculating class of McMurtry College. During your time at Rice, this will be your home and your support system. We are one of the newest colleges on campus, which means that each and every single Murt gets the incredibly unique and amazing opportunity to contribute to the future of McMurtry, through our ideas, our involvement, and our initiative. New students, remember this: We. Are. Murt. It’s not just a rallying call, it’s an identity. </p>
		<p>Before we leave you to your space preparation, we ask that you make sure to bring the one thing most essential for the exploration the final frontier - your open minds. Space is a whole entity of unknown territory waiting to be discovered by people just like you, and we hope you bring this same curious mind to McMurtry and to Rice. We’ll be exploring right alongside you, so prepare for the time of your life - and don’t forget to bring a space helmet! </p>
		<p> To McMurtry and Beyond! <br> Matt, Kelsi, and Rachel </p>
