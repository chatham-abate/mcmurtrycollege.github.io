	<h2> The Theme </h2>
	<div class='section-text'>
		<p> Univers(e)ally, we believe that space has a unique quality of uniting people. Transcending cultures, identities, and interests, space caters to any and all; there's a pocket of it that everyone can find applicable or enticing. We hope to capitalize upon and emphasize the ideas of not only universality, but also of connecting different kinds of people with a common bond that everyone can enjoy all throughout new Murts' introductions to life here at Rice. Most importantly, we hope to foster and instill in new students the community that we find so valuable at Rice and McMurtry, and we found space to be just the avenue to do so. </p>
		<p> We were especially enticed by the prospect of space because it didn't require specifically catered prior knowledge of certain pop culture, and it doesn't require one to possess a specific set of interests. We believe there's a bit of space for everyone -- whether it be through real life space exploration, space themed movies, or even silly space GIFs. When brainstorming potential ways in which we could weave space into our week, we ourselves embarking upon a seemingly endless supply of possible directions, and who's going to argue with having too many good possibilities? </p>
		<p> Our one greatest hope is that everyone finds their place in our space, both in our space-themed week and within McMurtry and Rice as a whole. We hope to introduce the newest class of Murts to the community in which they're more a part of than they even know yet, but also we hope to show them the true culture of McMurtry -- that it's as open as the exploration of space. Our concept of space is constantly evolving and growing, with new inventions, discoveries, and even new interpretations, just as McMurtry evolves with each new community member that joins. Everyone has the opportunity to make an impact, and we hope, through this week, we inspire you, the new students, to start on your path to making McMurtry your own. </p>
